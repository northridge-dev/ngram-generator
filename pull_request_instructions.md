# Pull Request Assignment

Once you're finished coding, submit a pull request. It should include the following:

## Title
The title of the pull request should be:
```
[Your Name] - Text-generating Ngram Language Model
```

## Overview

Describe for a general (non-technical) audience what your program does and how it works. This is your chance to practice communicating technical information to a non-technical audience.

## Design

Explain the design of your program. 
  - What are its main components?
  - How do those components interact with each other?

Include a diagram or flowchart if it would be helpful. 

## Technical Decisions

Describe major decisions you made in writing your program, for example, a problem you could have solved in multiple ways. Explain why you chose the solution you did. What were the trade-offs?

## Evaluation

How well does your program achieve its goals? What does it do well? Where does it come up short?

Consider:
  - the quality of its outputs
  - its efficiency -- does it use more memory or perform more computations than it needs to?
  - the clarity and quality of the code
